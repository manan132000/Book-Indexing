            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a 
                web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such 
                as JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia 
                web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance 
                of the document.
            </p> 
            <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as 
                interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by 
                denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML 
                elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img and input directly 
                introduce content into the page. Other tags such as p surround and provide information about document text and 
                may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the 
                content of the page.</p>    
            <p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content
                of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former
                maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit 
                presentational HTML since 1997.</p>

            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written
                in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and 
                JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and 
                fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the 
                specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying 
                the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content 
                as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the 
                file and its formatting.</p>
            <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles 
                for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen 
                reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is 
                accessed on a mobile device.</p>    
            <p>The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than 
                one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.</p>    
            <p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) 
                text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation 
                service for CSS documents. In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, 
                plain XML, SVG, and XUL.</p>

            <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 
                engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write 
                command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page 
                content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript 
                everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather 
                than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.</p>
            <p>
                Though .js is the standard filename extension for JavaScript code, the name "Node.js" doesn't refer to a 
                particular file in this context and is merely the name of the product. Node.js has an event-driven architecture 
                capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications 
                with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication 
                programs and browser games).</p>
              
            <p>The Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation, and has now 
            merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation, which is facilitated by the Linux Foundation's 
            Collaborative Projects program.</p>

            <p>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building 
                user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and 
                companies.React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. 
                However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React 
                applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side 
                functionality</p>
